Owl is social network application where we recreated the potential of a real social network such as: authorization and registration of the user, the ability to add or delete friends, online chat with friends, the ability to change information about yourself, upload new photos to your gallery, write posts, read friends newsfeed, etc.

### <span style="color: orange">How to run application:</span>

For the application to work, you need to install and run the server. Follow these steps to install the server:

  1. Clone this [Server repository](https://github.com/Bam6ycha/simple-api) to your computer and follow the instructions (for production) there:  

        `https://github.com/Bam6ycha/simple-api.git`

2. You should see the message in the console:

      `Server listen on port 6969`
3. Clone our [repository](https://github.com/zhuravskayalina/rss-social-network) to your computer, make sure you take the DEVELOP branch.

  1. At root project directory install dependencies:

        `npm install`
  1. Run server:

This technology makes it possible to constantly maintain a connection with the server - users can communicate online.
